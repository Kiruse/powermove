# Powermove
Powermove is my attempt to build a web 3 game that actually caters toward gamers rather than investors. In my humble opinion, almost all web 3 games are merely gamified investments. As an avid and passionate gamer myself, I haven't played a single web 3 game that tries to be more than a minigame simply because A) high entry barrier due to heavy use of artificially scarce playable characters, and B) "play to earn" is a bullshit concept designed to lure in unsuspecting victims.

Powermove does not force players to buy uniqueness. It allows players to evolve uniqueness.
