# Powermove Common Library
This crate contains the abstract basic foundation of the Powermove game which can be used in external tooling without a strict dependency on the game engine [bevy](https://bevyengine.org/). For example, we can use it to generate procedural content for the game and export it in a data format that can then be re-imported into the actual game.
